## 🩺 Software System: **NeumoDiagnostics**

### 📋 Overview
**NeumoDiagnostics** is an AI-powered support platform designed to assist doctors in reviewing patient radiographs for pneumonia detection. Our system integrates advanced machine learning with comprehensive patient management features.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: This model is designed to support, not replace, medical judgment. The final diagnosis always remains with the healthcare professional.
